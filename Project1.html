Deadliest day of attacks on Israel in country’s history
More people died in Israel in a single day than any other day since Israel became a state, according to Israel’s foreign press office. Around 700 Israelis had died since attacks began on Saturday, according to Israel’s foreign ministry as of 10:20 p.m. local time on Sunday. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 413 Palestinians had been killed.

Victorine Meurent, Manet’s favorite model, stands in an empty room, accompanied only by a parrot on a bird stand. Her trademark red hair is tied back with a blue ribbon. Her head is slightly bowed as she smells a nosegay in her right hand: probably a gift from an absent admirer, just like the gentleman’s monocle in her left. She’s wearing a silk peignoir, which Manet has rendered in buttery strokes of pink and white. This is a full-length image, more than six feet tall, but Victorine hasn’t even put on her best clothes. She’s in a dressing gown, and the gown is amorphous. The gown is only paint.

        But amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/10/09/world/israel-gaza-war-hamas">the worst attack on Israel in 50 years</a>, the high regard that Mr. Putin has shown for Israel in the past appears remarkably absent. More than three days after the start of the incursion by Hamas, there has been no message of condolence from the Kremlin, even though Mr. Putin previously published such notes of sympathy in the wake of terrorist attacks in Israel.

        Improving America’s schools can sometimes seem like an impossible task. Politicians have been promising to do so for decades, yet the U.S. remains well behind many other countries in basic measures of learning. The Covid pandemic, with its extended school closures, aggravated the problems.

        <br>But making progress really is possible, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/us/schools-pandemic-defense-department.html">story by my colleague Sarah Mervosh</a>
        describes perhaps the best case study. The network of schools run by the Defense Department has been performing well for years and continued to do so during the pandemic. These schools are typically on military bases, and they educate about 66,000 children of service members and Defense Department civilian employees.

        Amy Dilmar, a middle-school principal in Georgia, is well aware of the many crises threatening American education. The lost learning that piled up during the coronavirus pandemic. The gaping inequalities by race and family income that have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/us/covid-schools-at-home-learning-study.html">only gotten worse.</a> A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/us/us-students-international-test-scores.html">widening achievement gap</a> between the highest- and lowest-performing students.
<br>
        But she sees little of that at her school in Fort Moore, Ga.
<br>
The students who solve algebra equations and hone essays at Faith Middle School attend one of the highest-performing school systems in the country.
<br>
It is run not by a local school board or charter network, but by the Defense Department.

With about 66,000 students — more than the public school enrollment in Boston or Seattle — the Pentagon’s schools for children of military members and civilian employees quietly achieve results most educators can only dream of.
